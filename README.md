Sentiment.py: run as python sentiment.py enter the ticker hit enter. Quit with " " then enter or just ctrl+c

Every tweet with over 4 "$" is filtered out because those are usually spam

Only 5 tweets about a ticker are counted per username. So if someones spamming a ticker itll only count 5 of them. This can be tweaked to totally cut out spam.
